# Sync vs Async

## Descriprion
This is comparison between the synchronous and asynchronous code.
The function that the comparison uses downloads images from a website and writes them to the folder

## To launch
Install packages from `requirements.txt` and start the `compare.py` to see the difference\
(With 50 images I got: 17.26 seconds with sync version and 1.81 seconds with async version)
